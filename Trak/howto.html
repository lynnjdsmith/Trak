    <div class="title">How To</div>
    Enter triggers, symptoms and treatments in the log with as accurate timing as possible.
    <b>Perfection is not required! Just try to be as complete as you can.</b>
    <br />&nbsp;<br />
    <div class="subtitle">One Entry, Several Triggers</div>
    Two or more triggers can be in one entry. For example, 'Red Wine' is recorded as both red wine and alcohol.
    <br />&nbsp;<br />
    Remember, the more accurately you record encounters with a particular trigger, the better we can predict if it's making you sick.<br/>
